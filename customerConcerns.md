On dashboard > why does white cell have a org chart? It should be a people icon similar to the players icon
On dashboard > unit budget summary, can you add a column for total pax
Under units > I input 15 MSgts and it didn’t reflect a total in that space, but it did populate over to unit RPA and it populated over to the support cell instead. There’s no way to adjust total duty days for a MSgt – maybe it’s pulling from the overall duty days based on the selected dates when I created the exercise because all of the cells that say duty days are defaulted to 19. If it could break down to reflect where the $99,750 is coming from (is it mil pay + travel pay for Gulfport?) you could have it reflected in that manner in the blue font: Mil Pay: $, Travel pay: $, Total: $
There should be an option to select if a member or members are local and not incurring any travel pay costs
Under units > What does the long tour toggle indicate?
Under units > duty days, I’m unable to enter multiple digits for some reason, it kicks me out of the cell (bug)
Under units > It should probably look more like:
+ Add Details
Pop up asks for rank, count, duty days and location as a drop down. Each entry will be consecutive. At the top of each cell it will just count overall PAX
Under units, AE, CAB and SG:
All players costs should pull & calculate the financial details:
                                                              i.      Breakfast, lunch (mre) and dinner as RPA

                                                            ii.      Billeting costs as O&M

For any white cell staff and players field, can you add an entry that will let you enter an set, but adjustable amount of $400 for airfare/POV mileage
For any white cell staff on the travel side either RPA or O&M, can you enter a field that will allow you to enter an approx. # of rental vehicles and an adjustable amount per rental vehicles? I need to ensure this is captured in overall costs
Can you have a place where I can enter the overall budget for RPA and O&M, and some type of system that will display how “on-budget” the tracker is?
