Looking for some type of tracker that we can input amount of PAX that will then trickle down to show us an approximate budget. Here’s the information needed:

 

There will be a cost for players and a cost for white cell/support staff
I need a breakdown of RPA and O&M. RPA is for traditional reservists and O&M is for AGRs and civilians. For RPA it would be helpful for an area that addresses just the travel costs since some individuals will be on long tour orders and not need the mil pay side
There will be players on RPA and players on O&M, and white cell support staff on RPA and O&M. I need it all broken out but would like an overall cost calculator somewhere to account for total RPA and total O&M
I’ve attached a CPD – cost per day for ranks that will apply to RPA costs
White cell/support staff will be full per diem, players will be eating meals at the costs of: $14 per meal. They’ll get breakfast and dinner at this cost. For lunch they get MREs at the cost of $15.91 per meal. This falls into RPA costs
For the white cell/support staff, the two locations for per diem are Gulfport and Camp Shelby, MS. If there’s a way to pull the per diem and lodging costs from somewhere that would help. For airfare we can approximate $400 per person and we would need a way to enter an approximate number of rental cars to support the staff
For players, their billeting costs are $27/night. This cost will fall into the O&M category
I need a breakdown area for:
SG white cell/support staff costs, execution costs, player costs. Need an RPA and O&M category for each
AE white cell/support staff costs, execution costs, player costs. Need an RPA and O&M category for each
CAB white cell/support staff costs, execution costs, player costs. Need an RPA and O&M category for each
A7 exercise planning costs, support staff costs and execution costs. Need an RPA and O&M category for each
I need an area to put in the WRM cost – this falls under O&M
For O&M I’ll need an area that covers costs such as: contract costs, transportation costs, billeting, port a potty rentals, any other rentals we may need to do such as with the company VSCOS, consumables and any other category that I may need to add to capture O&M costs
 

Can we start here and see what it comes up with? My goal is to be able to toggle between amounts of white cell staff and players to see how it adjusts overall costs, along with having 1 spreadsheet that will capture the overall exercise costs.
